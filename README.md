# Just-Chess
It's just 2 player chess. A quick personal project.<br/>
Written in python, GUI created in tkinker.<br/>
### Features:
-Just chess<br/>
-Horrible chess engine written from scratch<br/>
-All the standard rules, except the 50 move rule (castling, en passant, promotions, etc)<br/>
-Move validation (you can't take the king even if you try)<br/>
-Export game to text file, in Forsythâ€“Edwards_Notation.<br/>
-Buttons and labels that don't do anything because I'm too lazy to implement them.<br/>
-More features might (probably won't) come soon, including an AI opponent.<br/>
### Running:
Run Chess.exe from the base directory. Have fun (you probably won't).<br/>
