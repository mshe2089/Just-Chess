# Just-Chess
It's just 2 player chess. <br/>
Written in python, GUI created in tkinker.<br/>
Was going to implement opponent with Pytorch but just coding chess logic was already a mouthful.<br/>
### Features:
-Just chess<br/>
-Horrible chess engine written from scratch<br/>
-All the standard rules, except the 50 move rule (castling, en passant, promotions, etc)<br/>
-Move validation (you can't take the king even if you try)<br/>
-Export game to text file, in Forsythâ€“Edwards_Notation.<br/>
-Buttons and labels that don't do anything because of laziness.<br/>
### Running:
Run the UI.pyw script in the src directory. You need an up-to-date python installation.<br/>
(temporary workaround, since a pyinstaller bug causes compiled executables to be labelled as malware)<br/>

You can build it into a standalone executable with pybuilder using the .spec file.<br/>

Have fun (you probably won't).<br/>
