# Just-Chess
Its just 2 player chess. A quick personal project.
Written in python, GUI created in tkinker.

#### Features:
-Just chess
-Horrible chess engine written from scratch
-All the standard rules, except the 50 move rule (castling, en passant, promotions, etc)
-Move validation (no placing the king in danger)
-Export game to text file, in Forsythâ€“Edwards_Notation.
-Buttons and labels that don't do anything because I'm too lazy to implement them.

-More features might (probably won't) come soon, including an AI opponent.

#### Running:
Run Chess.exe from the base directory. Have fun (you probably won't).
